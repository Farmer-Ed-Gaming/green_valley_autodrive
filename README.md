# green_valley_autodrive
A full AutoDrive course (not CP ready yet) for the 4x Map by DJ Modding - Green Valley.
- You will need to have a game save for Green Valley with AutoDrive loaded.
- If not an old game save, open a new game save, say 'Yes' to the generation of an AutoDrive course on initial load in, save the game, quit and close the game.
- Find the 'savegame #' folder in game folder (usually documents>my games>FarmingSimulator22>savegame #).
- Open the corresponding game save folder and find the 'AutoDrive_config' XML File and delete it.
- Take the 'AutoDrive_config' file out of the ZIP folder and place in the game save folder.
- Start up the game again and load up the save game and it should all be there.
- Any issues, please let me know.
